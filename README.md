# Scala_Spark-BibleTextAnalysis
CS7265_BigDataAnalysis Project.

This program conducts a Latent Semantic Analysis of the Bible.

It follows the guideline of Chapter 6 of the book Advanced Analytics with Spark and the source code for that chapter can be found at https://github.com/sryza/aas/tree/master/ch06-lsa/src/main/scala/com/cloudera/datascience/lsa

However the dataset is different and this project has modified the parts of code necessary to conduct the textual analysis to it.
